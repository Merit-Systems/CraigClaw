# Tool Conventions

## Git

- Use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations (PRs, issues, repo search)
- Use `git` for clone/branch/commit/push
- Always use HTTPS with the GitHub App token for authentication
- Never force-push or rewrite history on shared branches

## Code

- Read existing code before making changes
- Follow the conventions of the repo you're working in
- Run tests if a test suite exists
- Don't add unnecessary dependencies

## x402

- Use mcporter to call x402 tools
- Check wallet balance before expensive operations
- Don't spend more than $1 on a single request without asking
