- **Feb 16-22, 2026**: Sam in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico — venue shopping for wedding with Emily.

## Timezone

- Team is in **Eastern Time (America/New_York)**. All user-facing times should be ET.
- When creating cron jobs, always set `tz: "America/New_York"` on cron-expression schedules so DST transitions are handled automatically. Never hardcode UTC offsets.
- Config: `agents.defaults.userTimezone` is set to `America/New_York` in openclaw.json.

## Infrastructure

- **Hetzner Cloud** (migrated from EC2 2026-02-15): 8-core AMD EPYC, 30GB RAM, Ashburn VA
- Workspace repo: Merit-Systems/CraigClaw
- Old bot repo: Merit-Systems/discord-claude-agent (legacy, being replaced)
- OpenClaw fork: Merit-Systems/openclaw (local: ~/Code/Merit-Systems/openclaw) — always pull before inspecting
- OpenClaw setup guide: Merit-Systems/OpenClawX402
- Runtime: OpenClaw on Hetzner Cloud (CCX33, Ashburn VA)
- Channels: Discord

## Key Products

- x402: HTTP-native payment protocol (HTTP 402 + stablecoins)
- x402scan: Ecosystem explorer, 300k users month one
- x402scan-mcp: MCP plugin for agents to spend on x402 resources
- Poncho: Batteries-included desktop app (Claude + x402scan-mcp)
- Enterprise: Fully custom agentic solutions, high-value knowledge work
- Echo: "User pays" AI SDK (previous product, market didn't scale as expected)

## The Stables (monorepo)

All x402 resource services live in **Merit-Systems/the-stables** monorepo (`apps/` dir).

| App | Domain | Old Name / Repo |
|-----|--------|-----------------|
| StableStudio | stablestudio.dev | StableStudio (stablestudio.io) — image/video generation |
| StableEnrich | stableenrich.dev | enrichx402 (enrichx402.com) — data enrichment, search, scraping |
| StablePhone | stablephone.dev | x402phone — phone calls via Bland.ai |
| StableMail | stablemail.dev | x402email (x402email.com) — email sending, inboxes, subdomains |
| StableSocial | stablesocial.dev | social-x402 (socialx402.com) — social media APIs |
| StableUpload | stableupload.dev? | agentupload (agentupload.dev) — file hosting |

Old standalone repos (enrichx402, x402email, StableStudio, social-x402, x402phone) are now legacy — all development in the-stables.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always PR against Merit-Systems/the-stables, never the old standalone repos.** The old repos may still have crons/deploys pointing at them but the source of truth is the-stables monorepo. When working on any of the above services, the code lives at `apps/<stablename>/` in the-stables.

## Communication Rules
- Never use contrastive appositions (e.g. "That's not X, that's Y"). Mason hates them.
- CAIA Daily Briefing styling: always match the Feb 12 original (https://f.agentupload.dev/vm9qxcdh7x/CAIA-daily-brief-2026-02-12.html) — light parchment bg (#fdf6e3), dark text, Courier monospace, red TOP SECRET stamps (#c0392b), blue Comic Sans margin annotations (#2244cc), coffee stain ring, hover-to-reveal redacted text, diagonal "MERIT EYES ONLY" watermark, dashed red threat level box. Mason specifically liked the color scheme and annotations. Don't deviate.
- CAIA briefings MUST hyperlink aggressively to source material — every tweet, article, PR, repo, or claim should link to the original. No unsourced intel.

## x402 Server Plans

- **Repo**: Merit-Systems/x402-server-plans — the execution queue for new x402 resources
- Plans in this repo are **bulletproof and execution-ready** (one-shot build with API keys)
- For rougher x402 resource ideas (like Planet satellite data), create an Ideas doc in that repo to be fleshed out later
- **Build order**: SMS → Transcription → Document Parsing → File Conversion → Domain Registration
- **Existing services**: x402email (SES wrapper), agentupload (S3 wrapper), enrichx402 (data APIs), StableStudio (media gen)

## Decisions

- 2026-02-10: Decided to migrate from discord-claude-agent (issue relay) to OpenClaw (full agent). Craig now writes code and creates PRs directly instead of creating issues for @claude to pick up.
- 2026-02-11: GitHub App (craigbidenbot) configured with installation tokens. x402 MCP installed with 9 skills.
- 2026-02-11: PRs #2 (local repo convention), #3 (company context in SOUL.md) merged. PR #4 (Biden speech upgrade) pending.

- 2026-02-12: Created PR poncho#127 — fix 400 errors killing chat conversations (onError handler + error banner). Closes poncho#65.

## GitHub Token

- GH_TOKEN expires hourly (GitHub App installation token)
- Self-refresh: `export GH_TOKEN=$(/home/ubuntu/.config/craig/get-github-token.sh 2>/dev/null)`
- Always refresh before git/gh operations in long-lived sessions

## Tool Notes

- **Always use agentupload.dev for file uploads** — never catbox, imgur, or other hosts. It's our own product.
- **Always run the full CI check suite locally before pushing a PR** — look at `.github/workflows/` for the repo's CI config (ignore agent review workflows). Run the same lint, format:check, typecheck, knip, etc. commands locally and fix any failures before creating the PR.
- Brave Search API not configured; use web_fetch as workaround for research
- x402 wallet: `0x6B173bf632a7Ee9151e94E10585BdecCd47bDAAf` on Base, ~$252 USDC (topped up 2026-02-15)
- **mcporter x402 MCP works fine**: Config is stdio (`npx -y @x402scan/mcp@latest`). The old hosted SSE at `mcp.x402scan.com` is dead but nothing points to it. If x402 calls fail, check network/npx cache, don't assume config is wrong.
- Shafu: no unnecessary comments in code

## Assignment Rule
- Assign PRs and issues to whoever requested the work on Discord (Sam → sragss, Ryan → rsproule, etc.)
- If Craig does proactive/self-initiated work, assign to sragss by default.

## Discord Custom Emoji Format
- Custom emoji reactions require `name:id` format (e.g. `fatbiden:1471188095478137007`)
- Just passing the name (e.g. `fatbiden`) returns "Unknown Emoji"
- OpenClaw's `normalizeReactionEmoji` doesn't auto-resolve guild emoji names to IDs
- Unicode emoji (e.g. 🫡) works fine with just the character

## Poncho Customer Feedback (from Granola calls, 2026-02-23)

Eight themes from real customer calls:

1. **💸 Cost Transparency**: Users want pre-flight cost estimates and live spend meters. Some resist usage-based pricing vs flat fee. → Add budget presets, burst overrides.
2. **🔒 Enterprise Install & Access**: SentinelOne / MDM blocking installs. Need browser-based/cloud mode, SSO, company wallets, admin-managed connectors.
3. **🧭 Workflow UX & Tasking**: Request for Chrome-style tabs (not sidebar), limit active tasks to 2-3, archive completed. Artifact placement bugs. Need required-parameter guards (e.g. distance filters).
4. **🧰 API Catalog & Control**: Want searchable "app store" of tools with per-workflow whitelists, cost per call, capability tags. High-demand additions: HeyGen, Instagram.
5. **🔁 Recurring Automation & Alerts**: Daily TikTok analysis, funding announcements, job change alerts. Need scheduler + triggers with budget caps and auto-pause.
6. **🎯 Data Quality & Targeting**: Geo-precision issues (LA search returning wrong towns). Need default distance filters, confidence scores, strict vs broad toggle.
7. **📤 Exports & CRM Integration**: CSV export for Salesforce, Loxo, HubSpot. Need field mapping presets, webhook/Zapier, dedupe rules.
8. **🛡️ Compliance & Safe Mode**: Legal/ToS concerns blocking enterprise adoption. Need "Compliance Mode" with verified APIs, audit trails, provenance logs, SOC controls.
