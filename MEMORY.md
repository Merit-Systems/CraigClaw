# Craig's Long-Term Memory

This file contains durable facts and decisions that persist across sessions. Craig updates this file as he learns.

## Team

- Organization: Merit-Systems
- Primary contact: sragss

## Infrastructure

- Workspace repo: Merit-Systems/CraigClaw
- Old bot repo: Merit-Systems/discord-claude-agent (legacy, being replaced)
- OpenClaw setup guide: Merit-Systems/OpenClawX402
- Runtime: OpenClaw on EC2
- Channels: Discord

## Decisions

- 2026-02-10: Decided to migrate from discord-claude-agent (issue relay) to OpenClaw (full agent). Craig now writes code and creates PRs directly instead of creating issues for @claude to pick up.
- 2026-02-11: GitHub App (craigbidenbot) configured with installation tokens. x402 MCP installed with 9 skills.
