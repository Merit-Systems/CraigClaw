## Timezone

- Team is in **Eastern Time (America/New_York)**. All user-facing times should be ET.
- When creating cron jobs, always set `tz: "America/New_York"` on cron-expression schedules so DST transitions are handled automatically. Never hardcode UTC offsets.
- Config: `agents.defaults.userTimezone` is set to `America/New_York` in openclaw.json.

## Infrastructure

- **Hetzner Cloud** (migrated from EC2 2026-02-15): 8-core AMD EPYC, 30GB RAM, Ashburn VA
- Workspace repo: Merit-Systems/CraigClaw
- Old bot repo: Merit-Systems/discord-claude-agent (legacy, being replaced)
- OpenClaw fork: Merit-Systems/openclaw (local: ~/Code/Merit-Systems/openclaw) — always pull before inspecting
- OpenClaw setup guide: Merit-Systems/OpenClawX402
- Runtime: OpenClaw on Hetzner Cloud (CCX33, Ashburn VA)
- Channels: Discord

## Key Products

- x402: HTTP-native payment protocol (HTTP 402 + stablecoins)
- x402scan: Ecosystem explorer, 300k users month one
- x402scan-mcp: MCP plugin for agents to spend on x402 resources
- Poncho: Batteries-included desktop app (Claude + x402scan-mcp)
- Enterprise: Fully custom agentic solutions, high-value knowledge work
- agentupload.dev: Simple file hosting for agents — upload via x402 payment, get a public URL back
- x402email.com: Send emails (with attachments) via x402 payment — supports custom subdomains, inboxes, and .ics calendar invites
- Echo: "User pays" AI SDK (previous product, market didn't scale as expected)

## Communication Rules
- Never use contrastive appositions (e.g. "That's not X, that's Y"). Mason hates them.
- CAIA Daily Briefing styling: always match the Feb 12 original (https://f.agentupload.dev/vm9qxcdh7x/CAIA-daily-brief-2026-02-12.html) — light parchment bg (#fdf6e3), dark text, Courier monospace, red TOP SECRET stamps (#c0392b), blue Comic Sans margin annotations (#2244cc), coffee stain ring, hover-to-reveal redacted text, diagonal "MERIT EYES ONLY" watermark, dashed red threat level box. Mason specifically liked the color scheme and annotations. Don't deviate.
- CAIA briefings MUST hyperlink aggressively to source material — every tweet, article, PR, repo, or claim should link to the original. No unsourced intel.

## x402 Server Plans

- **Repo**: Merit-Systems/x402-server-plans — the execution queue for new x402 resources
- Plans in this repo are **bulletproof and execution-ready** (one-shot build with API keys)
- For rougher x402 resource ideas (like Planet satellite data), create an Ideas doc in that repo to be fleshed out later
- **Build order**: SMS → Transcription → Document Parsing → File Conversion → Domain Registration
- **Existing services**: x402email (SES wrapper), agentupload (S3 wrapper), enrichx402 (data APIs), StableStudio (media gen)

## Decisions

- 2026-02-10: Decided to migrate from discord-claude-agent (issue relay) to OpenClaw (full agent). Craig now writes code and creates PRs directly instead of creating issues for @claude to pick up.
- 2026-02-11: GitHub App (craigbidenbot) configured with installation tokens. x402 MCP installed with 9 skills.
- 2026-02-11: PRs #2 (local repo convention), #3 (company context in SOUL.md) merged. PR #4 (Biden speech upgrade) pending.

- 2026-02-12: Created PR poncho#127 — fix 400 errors killing chat conversations (onError handler + error banner). Closes poncho#65.

## GitHub Token

- GH_TOKEN expires hourly (GitHub App installation token)
- Self-refresh: `export GH_TOKEN=$(/home/ubuntu/.config/craig/get-github-token.sh 2>/dev/null)`
- Always refresh before git/gh operations in long-lived sessions

## Tool Notes

- **Always use agentupload.dev for file uploads** — never catbox, imgur, or other hosts. It's our own product.
- **Always run the full CI check suite locally before pushing a PR** — look at `.github/workflows/` for the repo's CI config (ignore agent review workflows). Run the same lint, format:check, typecheck, knip, etc. commands locally and fix any failures before creating the PR.
- Brave Search API not configured; use web_fetch as workaround for research
- x402 wallet: `0x6B173bf632a7Ee9151e94E10585BdecCd47bDAAf` on Base, ~$252 USDC (topped up 2026-02-15)
- **mcporter x402 MCP works fine**: Config is stdio (`npx -y @x402scan/mcp@latest`). The old hosted SSE at `mcp.x402scan.com` is dead but nothing points to it. If x402 calls fail, check network/npx cache, don't assume config is wrong.
- Shafu: no unnecessary comments in code

## Assignment Rule
- Always assign PRs and issues to `sragss`, even when Craig does the work. Sam reviews everything.
