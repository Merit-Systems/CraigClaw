## agentcash-router PRs
- **PR #81**: Revert baseUrl from VERCEL_URL to NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL. VERCEL_URL gives deployment-specific URLs, not canonical domains.
- **PR #85**: Normalize MPP credential source DID to plain address. MPP sets `source: did:pkh:eip155:<chainId>:<address>` but SIWX/x402 return plain `0x...`. Used viem `isAddress`/`getAddress`. Also fixed Tempo chain ID from 42431 to 4217.

## the-stables PRs
- **PR #76**: Added NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL shim (`VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL ?? VERCEL_URL`) to 5 stables routers missing it: stablesocial, stabledomains, stablephone, stablestudio, stableupload. Already had it: stableenrich, stabletravel, stablecrypto, stablejobs.
- **PR #86**: StableSocial Data365 credit burn fix + dynamic pricing:
  - Data365 was burning 1.7M credits vs 500K monthly allocation — followers endpoints were the main culprit
  - Added soft caps (2000) on all variable-count fields (max_followers, max_posts, etc.), max_page_size capped at 100
  - Added `max_following` param to all 4 following endpoints (previously unlimited)
  - Created `lib/pricing.ts` — dynamic pricing proportional to query size
  - Moved variable-count routes from flat PRICES map to explicit `.paid(fn)` with body-based pricing
  - Rewrote llms.txt with full pricing docs, per-unit costs, cost control tips
  - **OPEN QUESTION**: Credit cost per follower unknown — Data365 only publishes 4 examples on pricing page: 1 post=1 credit, 1 post+comments=5, 1 search=7, 1 profile with info=9. No per-endpoint breakdown. Need to ask Data365 contact or run a test to measure actual credit consumption per follower request.

## manhog PR #28
- Fixed dark mode: replaced `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` inline script with `next-themes` (`ThemeProvider` + `useTheme`). Also fixed npm→pnpm lockfile issue for Vercel deploy.

## x402scan migration
- Spawned sub-agent for agentcash-router migration PR — may still be pending

## Data365 pricing (what we know)
- Basic plan: €300/month, 500K credits, 1 social network
- Standard: €850/month, 1M credits, 2 networks
- Credit examples (from pricing page): 1 post=1cr, 1 post+comments=5cr, 1 search=7cr, 1 profile with info=9cr
- Ryan says each credit ≈ $0.002 (round up from $0.0017702875)
- Their docs are NOT public — sent privately after signup. No per-endpoint credit breakdown available online.
- Contact sent email about 1.7M credit usage spike from followers requests

## Key technical notes
- MPP credential source format: `did:pkh:eip155:<chainId>:<address>` (from mppx package)
- Tempo chain ID is 4217 (not 42431 as previously hardcoded)
- VERCEL_URL = deployment-specific (bad for canonical URLs), VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL = canonical domain (good)
- agentcash-router dynamic pricing: `.paid(fn, { maxPrice })` where fn receives parsed body
