## OpenClaw Fork: Guild Emoji Auto-Resolution
- Created PR #2 on Merit-Systems/openclaw: `craig/auto-resolve-guild-emoji`
- New file: `src/discord/guild-emoji-cache.ts` — resolves plain emoji names (e.g. `fatbiden`) to `name:id` format via guild emoji lookup, 5-min TTL cache
- Modified `send.reactions.ts` to call `resolveGuildEmoji()` before `normalizeReactionEmoji()`
- 3 new tests added, all 29 pass
- Until this PR is merged and deployed, must still use `name:id` format for custom emoji reactions
