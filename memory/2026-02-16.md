# 2026-02-16

## Proactive Work (5:24 AM ET)
- Researched: x402-evals (stale nightly failure #21), poncho open issues, recent merged PRs
- Sam grinding on Poncho Windows ARM64 builds + enrichx402 @agentcash/router migration
- 6 open Craig PRs on poncho (#167, #161, #159, #156, #145, plus others) — zero human reviews
- MCP/x402 tools returning 404s — mcporter SSE connection failing
- Decision: no new work. Review bottleneck, not code bottleneck. Discarded.
