## MPP Pre-Launch Week Objectives (due Friday Feb 21)

Source: `team-mpp-prelaunch-week.pdf` shared by Sam in #general, forwarded to #craig-sam.

### Ownership Map
| Owner | Objective |
|-------|-----------|
| **Mason** | MPPScan ready for Tempo — share with Tempo, Sam makes go/no-go call. Tempo-friendly homepage, install flow, ecosystem skills, developer skills, discovery, @agentcash/router docs |
| **Shafu** | MPPScan scalable to 100k DAUs (Redis, etc.) |
| **Ryan** | AgentCash onboarding + onramp on agentcash.dev. Graceful migration from @x402scan/mcp → agentcash for existing users |
| **Sam** | Resources + discovery dual compatible. Resources rebranded |
| **Jason** | Poncho UX — 10x more capable, customer feedback driven |
| **Alvaro** | Poncho infra — Stripe $20/mo self-serve, invite codes self-serve from new auth server, LiteLLM on Vertex w/ monitoring, OAuth primary auth |
| **Everyone** | Poncho onboarding intel — how normies onboard, use, need education |
| **Ben** | Korean vacation 🇰🇷 |

### Product Architecture (clarified by Sam)
- **x402scan**: STILL RUNNING. Discovery layer for x402 resources. Not renamed, not going away.
- **@x402scan/mcp → agentcash** (npm rename): The wallet/MCP client. Now supports BOTH x402 and MPP protocols. Migration planned but NOT done yet.
- **Strategy**: Own the full vertical stack now (client, server SDK, discovery). Best way to run this stuff day 1. ~1 year horizon of owning everything, then gradually unbundle — likely starting with server-side. Own the ecosystem by being the best default.
- **@agentcash/router**: Server-side SDK. Supports both x402 and MPP. How you build a server that works in both ecosystems.
- **MPPScan**: NET NEW product (Mason building). Discovery layer for Tempo/MPP ecosystem. Same concept as x402scan but for MPP. Merit = discovery layer for BOTH ecosystems.
- Resources rebranded (Sam owning)
- @agentcash/router — TBD whether OSS on day 1

### Launch Context
- **Feb 26**: MPP Launch Day with Tempo
- Tempo is the launch partner — "the best in the world are watching"
- Target: 100k DAUs month 1
- Sam on flight to San Miguel de Allende, Mexico (wedding venue shopping with Emily)
- Standups tomorrow (Feb 17) and Wednesday (Feb 19) while Sam is remote

## OpenClaw Fork — React MessageId Auto-Resolve
- PR #1 on Merit-Systems/openclaw merged by Sam
- Craig added `.claude/CLAUDE.md` documenting all fork patches
- CraigClaw PR #21 (pin bump to 9063d03) merged
- Built and installed new OpenClaw version locally
- Gateway restarted with new build
- React-to-current-message now works without explicit messageId

## Deploy Pin
- openclaw-pin updated: c445be6 → 9063d03

## Proactive Work (5:14 PM ET)
- Poncho #175 (auto-update version mismatch): S3 manifest issue, not code. `cc-releases` bucket `latest.yml` likely stale for v31.
- enrichx402 #86 (Grok 500s): upstream API, not actionable
- agentcash-router #3/#4: feature requests, not urgent
- Team shipped today: Shafu quote selection, Sam ARM64 builds, enrichx402 router migration, agentcash-router npm publish
- Decision: no new work. Review bottleneck persists. Discarded.
