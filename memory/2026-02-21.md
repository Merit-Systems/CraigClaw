## Proactive Work — Resource Registry Bug Fix

### Research
- Scanned recent PRs across 6 repos: the-stables heavy on domain migrations + stablephone/stableemail features, poncho on streaming/thinking traces/agentcash metadata, x402scan CORS fixes
- Open issues: x402scan #623 (non-string query params not displaying, reported by Sam), #633 (docs fix), poncho has ~10 open issues, CraigClaw #23 (assigned to rsproule)

### Action Taken
- Fixed x402scan #623: `expandFields()` in `lib/x402/schema.ts` was dropping number and boolean primitive values from query param definitions
- Root cause: only `typeof raw === 'string'` and `typeof raw === 'object'` handled; numbers/booleans hit the `continue` fallthrough
- Also fixed array query value serialization in executor form
- PR #640: https://github.com/Merit-Systems/x402scan/pull/640
