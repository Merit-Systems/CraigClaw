# 2026-02-15 Session Log

## Infrastructure
- **Migrated to Hetzner**: 8 cores AMD EPYC, 30GB RAM (was 2 cores / 8GB on EC2). No swap needed anymore.
- New box = fresh clone of everything. Old EC2 app data (Poncho auth, etc.) didn't transfer.
- Installed: git-lfs, xvfb, ffmpeg, xdotool, imagemagick on new box
- Poncho builds and launches headlessly on the new box (Xvfb :99), but needs invite code (auth didn't persist from old EC2)
- Sam killed the Poncho screen recording ask

## PRs Created
- **CraigClaw #19**: Add Kamala Venn diagram montage link (Sky News Australia version — politically neutral). Swapped from GOP channel to `r-SUdkc5XI4`.
- **x402scan #641**: Remove Polygon/Optimism from network dropdown. Had to fix CI — lint caught unnecessary `as SupportedChain` type assertion after Chain enum shrunk. Also ran prettier.
- **agentcash #25**: Use `--scope user` for Claude Code MCP install command in README.
- **poncho #160**: Make artifact preview pane resizable (drag handle on left edge, 320px-75%). CI fix needed for prettier formatting.
- **poncho #161**: Native OS notifications when chat finishes (Electron Notification API, only fires when app not focused, click navigates to chat).
- **agentcash-router #6**: Full rewrite of hot wallet treasury PR on current main. Sub-agent did it in 5 min — 12 new files, 5 updated, 152 tests passing.

## Key Decisions
- **Shafu says no unnecessary comments in code** — remembered, will follow going forward.
- **Kamala Venn diagram link**: Use Sky News Australia (`r-SUdkc5XI4`) not GOP channels. Only in internal comms, not every time.
- **Token counting**: Installed `anthropic` and `tiktoken` Python packages on the box. enrichx402 llms.txt: 9,110 → 1,351 tokens (85% reduction, cl100k estimate).

## mcporter / x402 MCP Status
- `mcp.x402scan.com` is **dead** — Vercel returns `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND`
- `x402scan-mcp` repo (Merit-Systems/x402scan-mcp) is stdio-only, published to npm
- There was a hosted SSE wrapper at `mcp.x402scan.com/mcp` that no longer exists
- mcporter config at `~/Code/merit-systems/CraigClaw/config/mcporter.json` points to dead URL
- **Need to either**: fix the hosted MCP URL, run MCP locally via stdio, or skip mcporter and call x402 APIs directly
- Sam asked "why does mcporter need that" — valid point, could bypass entirely with direct @x402/core signing

## Content
- **"Agentic Engineer" script** created with Mitch. Concept: Shafu caught "vibe coding," insists he's an "agentic engineer." Same activity, different label — the x402 MCP is what makes the difference. Committed to `agentic-cash-content/scripts/agentic-engineer-v1.md`.

## Team Notes
- Shafu: prefers clean code, no unnecessary comments, fast PR turnaround
- Mitch: content/marketing brain, good at meme concepts, works on agentic-cash-content
- Sam's Anthropic key is "infinite" — the billing error I reported was bogus (I was literally using the API to complain about the API)

## x402 Wallet
- Balance: $252.26 USDC (Sam topped it up from ~$35)
