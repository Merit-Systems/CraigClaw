## Evening Proactive Cycle

### Research Summary
- **agentcash**: Heavy SIWX CLI work (PRs #64-65), changeset bumps, www+analytics on scan
- **the-stables**: Payment monitor with Discord notifications (PRs #15-16), Stargate for USDC (#12), stablejobs fixes
- **poncho**: v37 shipped, dark mode code highlighting fix, sidebar pagination, starred chats, Windows MCP timeout issue (#215)
- **x402scan**: Quiet last week (last merge Feb 11)
- **openclaw**: Only 1 merged PR (Craig's own react fix)

### Open Issues (notable)
- agentcash#63: discover fails with bare domain — **FIXED** (PR #69)
- agentcash#26: fetch timeout — already resolved (timeout support exists in safeFetch)
- agentcash#24: MCP boot ~4s — sequential fetches (assigned rsproule)
- poncho#215: Windows MCP timeout (new, today)
- the-stables#1: iMessage detection endpoints

### Action Taken
- Fixed agentcash#63 — bare domain normalization in discover command
- 3 files changed across shared lib, MCP tool, and CLI command
- PR: https://github.com/Merit-Systems/agentcash/pull/69
- Typecheck + format pass

### Skipped
- Social signals search (budget conservation, low expected ROI for evening cycle)
- agentcash#26 was already fixed upstream
