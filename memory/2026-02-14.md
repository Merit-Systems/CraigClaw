## Prank Calls via x402phone.dev
- **Valentine's Day call to Sam** (914-819-2831): Craig Biden love poem about kerning and Figma. Emily heard the whole thing. Epic.
- **Ryan Sproule call** (412-780-2335): Günther Pfefferkorn (EDSOB), Poncho/DWTSAF compliance violation, Craig Biden named as informant. Call ID `19215ce6`, ~2 min, $0.285. Answered by human, voicemail left.
- **Mason call** (609-339-8647): Jean-Pierre Boulangerie (ECDCC, cookie compliance). Scheduled via cron for 10:02am ET. May need re-fire with `voicemail_action: "ignore"`.
- **TJ Ragsdale call**: Confirmed `voicemail_action: "ignore"` works — test call successfully left voicemail. Full Volkov-Svensson monologue pending.
- **Key learning**: Bland.ai `voicemail_action: "leave_message"` doesn't work (kills call before beep). Use `"ignore"` to bypass detection entirely.
