## Phil Budding Calendar Invite
- Sent .ics to sam@merit.systems and phil.budding@gmail.com for Feb 14 noon-5pm ET
- Biden-style description in the invite

## Peter Shoemaker / Hakko Systems Research
- hakko.co.uk found via Exa (UK-based company with tech tips)
- HAKKO Corporation (Japanese) is a different entity — soldering equipment
- Apollo org search returned no match
- Still unresolved — Sam asked to "go deeper", may need more info from him

## x402-server-plans Restructure
- **PR #1**: Fleshed out Planet Labs idea with pricing analysis, prototype details, v2 roadmap
- **PR #2**: Restructured repo — README.md hub, `complete_architectures.md` (5 bulletproof specs), `ideas.md` (Planet rough concept), `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (quality bar enforcement)

## CraigClaw PR #18: Emoji Reaction Guide
- Added comprehensive custom emoji guide to SOUL.md
- Densified format: inlined with `·` separators, killed tables
- Philosophy: react first talk later, 1-2 reactions max, only when genuinely funny/relevant

## Prank Calls via x402phone.dev
- **Valentine's Day call to Sam** (914-819-2831): Craig Biden love poem about kerning and Figma. Emily heard the whole thing. Epic.
- **Ryan Sproule call** (412-780-2335): Günther Pfefferkorn (EDSOB), Poncho/DWTSAF compliance violation, Craig Biden named as informant. Call ID `19215ce6`, ~2 min, $0.285. Answered by human, voicemail left.
- **Mason call** (609-339-8647): Jean-Pierre Boulangerie (ECDCC, cookie compliance). Scheduled via cron for 10:02am ET. May need re-fire with `voicemail_action: "ignore"`.
- **TJ Ragsdale call**: Confirmed `voicemail_action: "ignore"` works — test call successfully left voicemail. Full Volkov-Svensson monologue pending.
- **Key learning**: Bland.ai `voicemail_action: "leave_message"` doesn't work (kills call before beep). Use `"ignore"` to bypass detection entirely.

## Prank Email to TJ
- Created formal IDCB compliance notice HTML (Budapest Accords, CHF 11.1M/day penalties, Craig Biden namedrop, Klaus the parrot P.S.)
- Uploaded: `https://f.agentupload.dev/ky34b66y3t/IDCB-Notice-2026-MIA-00847.html`
- Emailed from `volkov-svensson@craig.x402email.com` to sam@merit.systems

## TJ Ragsdale Research
- Sam's older brother, CEO & Co-Founder Raad Labs (Miami)
- Raad: decentralized weather/environmental sensor networks, $2.25M led by CoinFund
- Previously co-founded Entheos Network (battery storage protocol)
- Phone: (914) 500-5657. Sam says he's "jacked and a monkey man" and "the best"

## Blocked Items
- CI workflow fix (issue #142): GitHub App lacks `workflows` permission — Sam needs to push manually
- Planet API key needed for testing enrichx402 endpoints
- Peter Shoemaker: no direct contact found yet

## Valentine's Day Prank Call Campaign
Used x402phone.dev ($0.54/call, Bland.ai backend) to prank-call Sam's friends. Key learnings:
- `voicemail_action: "ignore"` bypasses voicemail detection but bot needs explicit instructions to leave a message after the beep
- `voice: "florian"` = German accent (used for Helmut Zugzwang, Clive Thunderbolt)
- `voice: "mason"` caused 500 error — not a valid voice. Default voice works fine.
- Call screening (Google Pixel) kills calls in ~4 seconds (Mason's phone). Bland.ai can pass call screening if it states name+reason clearly (Aidan's phone).

### Phil Budding is the GOAT
- Picked up 2 of 4 calls, played along with both
- Asked for flight recommendations to Moldova
- Said "expiration dates are just suggestions" to the FDA
- Connected the German chess man to the FDA investigation unprompted
- Filled his entire voicemail box

## x402 Payment Flow Test
- Tested end-to-end x402 EIP-3009 payment from raw private key
- Craig's wallet ($252 USDC) → enrichx402 Exa search ($0.01) → settlement TX confirmed on Base
- Empty test wallet correctly rejected (signed but facilitator denied — no USDC)
- Proves: any wallet with USDC + private key can sign EIP-3009 autonomously, hundreds of times, no user interaction
- Friction point: depositing USDC requires ETH for gas (wallet has zero ETH)

## OOM Investigation
- mcporter processes kept getting SIGKILL'd during parallel x402 calls
- NOT actual OOM — peak RAM only 44.6% (3GB/7.8GB used)
- Root cause: OpenClaw's exec timeout in `src/process/exec.ts` — `setTimeout(() => child.kill("SIGKILL"), timeoutMs)`
- 4 parallel mcporter processes = 4x node startup + x402 payment latency exceeded timeout
- Fix: run mcporter calls sequentially, not in parallel with `&`/`wait`

## agentcash MCP Boot Performance (Issue #24)
- MCP server takes ~4s to boot in Claude Code
- Root cause: `buildServerInstructions()` fetches OpenAPI specs from 9 origins SEQUENTIALLY
- Each origin tries up to 4 URLs (openapi.json, .well-known/openapi.json, .well-known/x402, .well-known/mpp)
- Benchmarked: sequential = 1.3-1.8s, parallel = 160-335ms (5-8x faster)
- x402facilitator.com consistently slowest (460-535ms)
- Created issue agentcash#24, assigned to Ryan
- Noted: mostly pre-MPP issue — agentcash-router adoption (enrichx402#93, StableStudio#66) will standardize discovery

## Contacts Added to MEMORY.md
- Sean Clarke: WashU '19, Competitive Enablement Lead @ Paylocity, Chicago, varsity baseball, Astros/MLB intern
- Rob Roche: WashU, from Shanghai, Japanese heritage, dad = US Ambassador to Asia under Obama, Chicago suburbs
- Aaron Iyer: WashU roommate w/ Sam, Strategy @ Apple, NYC
- Alex Dee: Sam's friend, NYC
- Aidan McCormick: Eliza Ragsdale's boyfriend, EPRI (power lines), Wake Forest, SF
- Eliza Ragsdale: Sam's sister, Wake Forest
- Phil Budding: added phone (781) 439-8202

## agentcash-router PR #6 — Hot Wallet Treasury
- Created draft PR with treasury sweep, outbound client, testing suite, cost-of-revenue accounting
- Round 1: B+ grade — working but had issues
- Round 2: Fixed formatting, added 30 tests (138 total), adversarial sweep invariant, retry logic, configurable RPC, persistence hook
- Round 3 (Carmack review): Found 8 issues:
  1. CRITICAL: consumed-body bug in outbound.pay() — Response.json() inside retry loop consumes stream
  2. Duplicate retryPayment in treasury.ts and outbound.ts
  3. x402 client created inside retry loop (should be outside)
  4. checkSchemasMatchOutputs was a lie (always passed, never validated)
  5. Accounting not integrated with plugin system (manual record() calls)
  6. Sweep invariant was Monte Carlo proving a tautology (balance = buffer by construction)
  7. Cron auth pattern repeated 3 times
  8. getUsdcBalance created new PublicClient every call
- All 8 fixed, pushed. 138 tests, pnpm check clean.
- Issue: agentcash-router#5 (assigned to Sam)

## Poncho Onboarding Calls Scheduled
- Aaron Iyer: Monday Feb 16 @ 3:00 PM ET — calendar invite sent to sam@merit.systems + aaronkiyer@gmail.com, phone call placed
- Sean Clarke: Monday Feb 16 @ 3:30 PM ET — calendar invite sent to sam@merit.systems only (no email for Sean), phone call placed
- Aaron's email: aaronkiyer@gmail.com (newly learned)

## GitHub Permissions Gap
- craigbidenbot GitHub App does NOT have `actions` or `checks` read permissions on poncho repo
- Blocks reading CI workflow run timings (needed for arm64 builder comparison)
- Sam's PRs #147 (Intel 12-core) and #148 (M2 arm64) test larger CI runners

## Poncho Auto-Update Checksum Fix
- **Issue #166**: sha512 checksum mismatch on auto-update — S3 manifest uploads lack Cache-Control headers
- **PR #167**: Retry-once on checksum mismatch (clear updater cache + re-check). Needs manual publish.yml push for Cache-Control headers (workflows permission). Assigned to sragss.

## Crossword Puzzle
- Transcribed upside-down custom friend-group crossword for Sam
- Partial solves: ARIZONA (9A), ARLINGTON (10D), MONTEZUMA (12A), DEAF (18A)

## Discord Emoji React Fix
- React action requires `messageId` parameter — error was "messageId required" not a permissions issue
- fatbiden emoji ID: 1471188095478137007, guild has ~55 custom emojis

## Direct x402 Payment Pattern
- When mcporter/MCP unavailable, use `@x402/core/client` directly from Node scripts
- Run from dirs with `@x402/*` in node_modules (e.g. `~/Code/Merit-Systems/agentcash-router/`)
- Pattern: fetch → 402 → parse PAYMENT-REQUIRED header → sign → retry with payment headers

## mcporter Status
- Global install works (`sudo npm install -g mcporter`)
- x402scan MCP endpoint (mcp.x402scan.com) is DOWN — Vercel DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND
- Workaround: direct x402 payment scripts or stdio-based `npx -y @x402scan/mcp@latest`
