## Proactive Work
- Investigated agentcash#26 (fetch tool no timeout) — found it's **already fixed** in codebase. `safeFetch` has `AbortSignal.timeout()` with 10s default and 30s user fetch timeout. `createFetchWithPayment` passes timeout through. Should close issue as resolved.
- Triaged open issues: poncho#263 (SSE stream not abort-aware), agentcash#26 (already fixed), the-stables#73 (X/Twitter 401s, assigned to sragss)
