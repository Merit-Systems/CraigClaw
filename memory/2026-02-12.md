# 2026-02-12

## Proactive Run (22:00 UTC)

### Research
- Recent merges: Poncho fixes (shell path, artifact drag, Sentry), manual-hog OG images, giga-claude cleanup
- Open issues reviewed: Poncho chat icon bug (#114/#115 from shafu), x402-evals nightly failure (#21), x402scan-skills agentupload (#2)

### Actions
- Commented on x402scan-skills#2: upload-and-share skill already exists, issue can be closed
- Investigated Poncho chat icon bug (#114): uses Lucide SVG components not file assets. Insufficient context to fix without reproduction or screenshot from Shafu. Didn't submit a PR.

### Infrastructure
- EC2 upgraded: now 7.8GB RAM (was 1.9GB), disk at 26%

## Session 4 (cont'd)

### PRs Created
- CraigClaw PR #7: Add agentupload.dev and x402email.com one-liners to SOUL.md Key Products (per Sam's request)
- mppscan PR #1: Mobile styling fixes — try section stacks vertically, ASCII hero hidden on mobile (replaced with text), server page name/badge wraps properly

### Email Domain
- Bought `craig.x402email.com` subdomain ($5 USDC) — can send from any@craig.x402email.com at $0.005/email
- Subdomain send initially 500'd — SES needed extra time after verification. Sam fixed server-side, works now.
- Used addresses: `classified@`, `hr@`, `chief-brand-officer@`

### Emails Sent
- CAIA Intelligence Briefing (classified@craig.x402email.com) to sam@merit.systems, then all 8 team members individually
- Ryan's "performance review" from hr@craig.x402email.com — five stars, concern about 522 Twitter followers
- Emily Devery email from chief-brand-officer@craig.x402email.com to emily.b.devery@gmail.com + sam@merit.systems — personalized dossier, she's a designer at Goodby Silverstein & Partners, Boulder/USC/London/NYC

### CAIA Briefing
- Hosted at https://f.agentupload.dev/vm9qxcdh7x/CAIA-daily-brief-2026-02-12.html
- Fake CIA-style intelligence briefing about agentic commerce, team SOCINT, ACP/UCP enemy intel

### Lucas Slideshow (completed from prior session)
- Sub-agent generated all 8 images and uploaded to agentupload.dev but got stuck building HTML
- I built the slideshow and uploaded: https://f.agentupload.dev/wm8x5ts9as/lucas_soho_slideshow.html

### Emily Devery Research
- Designer at Goodby Silverstein & Partners (legendary ad agency)
- Grew up in Boulder, CO; studied design + marketing at USC; lived in LA, Dallas, SF, London, NYC
- Has done design work for Merit Systems (Sam's company)
- Sam's fiancée; email: emily.b.devery@gmail.com
- Portfolio: emilydevery.com
- AI image edits attempted but StableStudio queue was backed up — 4 jobs stuck at "loading"

### Team Emails (burned to MEMORY.md)
- sam@merit.systems, ryan@merit.systems, shafu@merit.systems, mason@merit.systems, alvaro@merit.systems, jason@merit.systems, ben@merit.systems, mitch@merit.systems
- team@merit.systems exists but Craig is blocked from sending to it

### Sub-agent Issues
- Both lucas-slideshow and emily-email sub-agents got stuck in process polling loops
- Pattern: they fire background jobs, poll them, and get stuck in infinite poll cycles when jobs take >30s
- Workaround: check sub-agent transcript for completed work, finish manually

### New Repo
- mppscan (Merit-Systems/mppscan): MPP Explorer, Next.js app, uses Tailwind v4, biome for linting, ClickHouse for data. CI: `pnpm check` = biome check + typecheck

### Inbox Setup
- Bought `craig@x402email.com` inbox ($1/month, expires 2026-03-14) — programmatic mailbox, retainMessages enabled, no forwarding
- CraigClaw PR #8: Add email inbox check to heartbeat (every 30 min, check for unread messages, notify Discord)
- x402email now has full inbox messages API: /api/inbox/messages ($0.001), /api/inbox/messages/read ($0.001), /api/inbox/messages/delete (free)

### x402email PR
- x402email PR #9: docs fix — clarify that `to` is always a JSON array in send endpoints (both .well-known/x402 and llms.txt)
- Common agent bug: models read `{to, subject, ...}` in discovery instructions and pass a string instead of array, getting 400

### Team Photos
- Saved to ~/Code/merit-systems/CraigClaw/assets/team-photos/
- Mason Hall (mason-hall.png, 1203x1203 from masonhall.tech) — only one meeting 800x800 target
- Sam, Ryan, Shafu, Jason, Alvaro: 460x460 from GitHub avatars
- Ben Reilly (ben.jpg, 390x390 from GitHub @zdql)
- Mitch: no photo found, no GitHub/LinkedIn discoverable — need last name
- LinkedIn profiles found: Sam (sam-ragsdale-2ba55b122), Ryan (ryansproule), Shafu (sharif-elfouly-975146142), Mason (hallmason), Jason (jason-hedman), Alvaro (alvaro-echevarria-cuesta-6687b91b4)
- GitHub avatars cap at 460x460 native; LinkedIn via Apollo returns 200x200; direct LinkedIn scraping blocked

### Team Member Full Names (discovered)
- Ben = Ben Reilly (GitHub: @zdql)
- Shafu = Sharif Elfouly (GitHub: @shafu0x)
- Mason Hall (GitHub: @fmhall)
- Alvaro Echevarria Cuesta (GitHub: @alvaroechevarriacuesta)

### Memory Updates
- Added agentupload.dev and x402email.com to MEMORY.md Key Products section, pushed directly to main
- Added all team member emails to MEMORY.md
- Added craig@x402email.com inbox details to MEMORY.md

## Session 5 (late evening)

### Mitch Photo
- Mitch (Discord: outperformed, ID 363520312329109504) sent a photo — saved to assets/team-photos/mitch.png (906x1144)
- Self-described as "the slopmongerer"
- Committed + pushed to main

### Mason: User Feedback Issues
- Created poncho#129: Source citations for paid vs free API results + token pollution
- Created enrichx402#86: Grok x-search returning 500 errors
- Created x402scan#638: New x402 resource ideas (review aggregation, recipe sites)
- Feedback from a power user burning through wallet on enterprise research — wants to refer a recruiting agency friend

### Sam: Meme Pipeline (Captain Phillips / "I'm the Shafu Now")
- Full pipeline: nano-banana-pro edit ($0.13) → face swap Sam onto Captain Phillips template → Python/PIL meme text
- Then: veo-3.1 video generation ($1-1.60) → ffmpeg crop 16:9→square → x402puppet.com face animation ($0.05)
- Multiple iterations — Sam wanted more stable driving video, text "LOOK AT ME" top + "I'M THE SHAFU NOW" bottom
- Built SIWX (Sign-In-With-X) polling script at /tmp/siwx_poll.cjs using ethers + siwe libraries (installed in /tmp/node_modules)
- Key discovery: mcporter can't handle StableStudio's SIWX auth for job polling or upload confirm — must use custom script
- SIWX format: SiweMessage from `siwe` npm package → prepareMessage() → ethers wallet.signMessage() → base64 JSON payload with {domain, address, uri, version, chainId, type:"eip191", nonce, issuedAt, expirationTime, signature}
- ffmpeg installed on EC2 via apt
- Sent animated meme to emily.b.devery@gmail.com via classified@craig.x402email.com

### CAIA Daily Briefing Cron
- Mason requested daily morning briefing with agentic commerce news + witty commentary
- Set up cron job (ID: b0228de7-308f-40eb-9000-e4854afc45ee) — runs daily at 10am ET (14:00 UTC)
- Isolated agentTurn session: researches Twitter/Reddit/news via x402, builds CIA-style HTML briefing, uploads to agentupload, emails all 8 team members, posts summary to Discord
- Budget: $0.30/run in x402 calls

### socialx402.com Strategic Analysis
- Sam asked for highest-leverage use of socialx402.com with $5 budget
- Sub-agent explored all platforms — **all 47 endpoints returning 500s** (service is down)
- Report uploaded: https://f.agentupload.dev/cgavf62cyq/socialx402-report.html
- Emailed to sam@merit.systems from analyst@craig.x402email.com
- Key recommendation: Autonomous Competitive Intelligence Agent — $1.08/run across 5 x402 merchants, replaces $2k/mo Brandwatch/Meltwater, 185x value multiplier
- socialx402.com: 47 endpoints, 7 platforms (TikTok 14, Instagram 7, YouTube 7, X/Twitter 5, Reddit 4, Facebook 7, TikTok Shop 3), mostly $0.02/req

### x402 Spending This Session
- nano-banana-pro edit: $0.13
- veo-3.1-fast video: $1.00
- veo-3.1 video x2: $3.20
- x402puppet x4: $0.20
- StableStudio uploads x4: $0.04
- x402puppet uploads x3: $0.03
- x402email sends: ~$0.02
- agentupload: ~$0.02
- Approximate total: ~$4.64

### Tool Notes
- ffmpeg now installed on EC2
- SIWX polling script: /tmp/siwx_poll.cjs (requires /tmp/node_modules with ethers@6 + siwe)
- x402puppet.com upload confirm endpoint returns "Upload not found or expired" — but generate works fine with unconfirmed blob URLs
- socialx402.com has www redirect (socialx402.com → www.socialx402.com)
