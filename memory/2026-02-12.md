# 2026-02-12

## Proactive Run (22:00 UTC)

### Research
- Recent merges: Poncho fixes (shell path, artifact drag, Sentry), manual-hog OG images, giga-claude cleanup
- Open issues reviewed: Poncho chat icon bug (#114/#115 from shafu), x402-evals nightly failure (#21), x402scan-skills agentupload (#2)

### Actions
- Commented on x402scan-skills#2: upload-and-share skill already exists, issue can be closed
- Investigated Poncho chat icon bug (#114): uses Lucide SVG components not file assets. Insufficient context to fix without reproduction or screenshot from Shafu. Didn't submit a PR.

### Infrastructure
- EC2 upgraded: now 7.8GB RAM (was 1.9GB), disk at 26%
