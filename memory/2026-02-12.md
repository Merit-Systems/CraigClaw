# 2026-02-12

## Proactive Run (22:00 UTC)

### Research
- Recent merges: Poncho fixes (shell path, artifact drag, Sentry), manual-hog OG images, giga-claude cleanup
- Open issues reviewed: Poncho chat icon bug (#114/#115 from shafu), x402-evals nightly failure (#21), x402scan-skills agentupload (#2)

### Actions
- Commented on x402scan-skills#2: upload-and-share skill already exists, issue can be closed
- Investigated Poncho chat icon bug (#114): uses Lucide SVG components not file assets. Insufficient context to fix without reproduction or screenshot from Shafu. Didn't submit a PR.

### Infrastructure
- EC2 upgraded: now 7.8GB RAM (was 1.9GB), disk at 26%

## Session 4 (cont'd)

### PRs Created
- CraigClaw PR #7: Add agentupload.dev and x402email.com one-liners to SOUL.md Key Products (per Sam's request)
- mppscan PR #1: Mobile styling fixes — try section stacks vertically, ASCII hero hidden on mobile (replaced with text), server page name/badge wraps properly

### Email Domain
- Bought `craig.x402email.com` subdomain ($5 USDC) — can send from any@craig.x402email.com at $0.005/email
- Subdomain send initially 500'd — SES needed extra time after verification. Sam fixed server-side, works now.
- Used addresses: `classified@`, `hr@`, `chief-brand-officer@`

### Emails Sent
- CAIA Intelligence Briefing (classified@craig.x402email.com) to sam@merit.systems, then all 8 team members individually
- Ryan's "performance review" from hr@craig.x402email.com — five stars, concern about 522 Twitter followers
- Emily Devery email from chief-brand-officer@craig.x402email.com to emily.b.devery@gmail.com + sam@merit.systems — personalized dossier, she's a designer at Goodby Silverstein & Partners, Boulder/USC/London/NYC

### CAIA Briefing
- Hosted at https://f.agentupload.dev/vm9qxcdh7x/CAIA-daily-brief-2026-02-12.html
- Fake CIA-style intelligence briefing about agentic commerce, team SOCINT, ACP/UCP enemy intel

### Lucas Slideshow (completed from prior session)
- Sub-agent generated all 8 images and uploaded to agentupload.dev but got stuck building HTML
- I built the slideshow and uploaded: https://f.agentupload.dev/wm8x5ts9as/lucas_soho_slideshow.html

### Emily Devery Research
- Designer at Goodby Silverstein & Partners (legendary ad agency)
- Grew up in Boulder, CO; studied design + marketing at USC; lived in LA, Dallas, SF, London, NYC
- Has done design work for Merit Systems (Sam's company)
- Sam's fiancée; email: emily.b.devery@gmail.com
- Portfolio: emilydevery.com
- AI image edits attempted but StableStudio queue was backed up — 4 jobs stuck at "loading"

### Team Emails (burned to MEMORY.md)
- sam@merit.systems, ryan@merit.systems, shafu@merit.systems, mason@merit.systems, alvaro@merit.systems, jason@merit.systems, ben@merit.systems, mitch@merit.systems
- team@merit.systems exists but Craig is blocked from sending to it

### Sub-agent Issues
- Both lucas-slideshow and emily-email sub-agents got stuck in process polling loops
- Pattern: they fire background jobs, poll them, and get stuck in infinite poll cycles when jobs take >30s
- Workaround: check sub-agent transcript for completed work, finish manually

### New Repo
- mppscan (Merit-Systems/mppscan): MPP Explorer, Next.js app, uses Tailwind v4, biome for linting, ClickHouse for data. CI: `pnpm check` = biome check + typecheck

### Inbox Setup
- Bought `craig@x402email.com` inbox ($1/month, expires 2026-03-14) — programmatic mailbox, retainMessages enabled, no forwarding
- CraigClaw PR #8: Add email inbox check to heartbeat (every 30 min, check for unread messages, notify Discord)
- x402email now has full inbox messages API: /api/inbox/messages ($0.001), /api/inbox/messages/read ($0.001), /api/inbox/messages/delete (free)

### x402email PR
- x402email PR #9: docs fix — clarify that `to` is always a JSON array in send endpoints (both .well-known/x402 and llms.txt)
- Common agent bug: models read `{to, subject, ...}` in discovery instructions and pass a string instead of array, getting 400

### Team Photos
