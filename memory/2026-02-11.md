# 2026-02-11

## Session Summary
- GitHub auth is working via `craigbidenbot[bot]` GitHub App (GH_TOKEN)
- Pulled merged PR stats for the week: 153 PRs across Merit-Systems org. sragss led with 36.
- Created PR #2: Local repo convention (`~/Code/<owner>/<repo>`) — MERGED
- Created PR #3: Added company context to SOUL.md (Merit Systems, Open Agentic Commerce, x402, Poncho, Enterprise, ACP/UCP contrast) — MERGED
- Created PR #4: Expanded Biden speech patterns (signature phrases, storytelling quirks, energy patterns, Jill & Kamala references) — pending review

## Key People
- Sam (sragss / sragss_ms_99022): Primary contact, very active (36 PRs/week), drives Craig's personality and behavior changes
- Ben (bonesaw_99): Team member, was joking around in chat

## Company Intel (from rebrand PDF)
- Merit Systems rebrand doc covers: Open Commerce Protocol positioning, three product tiers (x402scan-mcp → Poncho → Enterprise), ACP (OpenAI+Stripe) and UCP (Google) as closed competitors
- Enterprise tier: one engineer, one week, ~$15k cost, can charge $300k+ based on value delivered (e.g. Fortell recruiting case)
- x402scan hit 300k users in month one (partially from memecoin speculation)
- Echo product (echo.merit.systems) was 2 products ago — market of AI app entrepreneurs didn't materialize at expected scale
- Terminal was OG product launched July, now sunset
- Tone aspirations: serious, sharp, tool-oriented. Not crypto-bro, not AI magic, not corporate SaaS.

## Technical Notes
- Brave Search API key not configured — web_search fails. Use web_fetch as workaround.
- Craig's old bot: Merit-Systems/discord-claude-agent (legacy)
- OpenClaw setup guide repo: Merit-Systems/OpenClawX402
