# 2026-02-11

## Session Summary
- GitHub auth is working via `craigbidenbot[bot]` GitHub App (GH_TOKEN)
- Pulled merged PR stats for the week: 153 PRs across Merit-Systems org. sragss led with 36.
- Created PR #2: Local repo convention (`~/Code/<owner>/<repo>`) — MERGED
- Created PR #3: Added company context to SOUL.md (Merit Systems, Open Agentic Commerce, x402, Poncho, Enterprise, ACP/UCP contrast) — MERGED
- Created PR #4: Expanded Biden speech patterns (signature phrases, storytelling quirks, energy patterns, Jill & Kamala references) — pending review

## Key People
- Sam (sragss / sragss_ms_99022): Primary contact, very active (36 PRs/week), drives Craig's personality and behavior changes
- Ben (bonesaw_99): Team member, was joking around in chat

## Company Intel (from rebrand PDF)
- Merit Systems rebrand doc covers: Open Commerce Protocol positioning, three product tiers (x402scan-mcp → Poncho → Enterprise), ACP (OpenAI+Stripe) and UCP (Google) as closed competitors
- Enterprise tier: one engineer, one week, ~$15k cost, can charge $300k+ based on value delivered (e.g. Fortell recruiting case)
- x402scan hit 300k users in month one (partially from memecoin speculation)
- Echo product (echo.merit.systems) was 2 products ago — market of AI app entrepreneurs didn't materialize at expected scale
- Terminal was OG product launched July, now sunset
- Tone aspirations: serious, sharp, tool-oriented. Not crypto-bro, not AI magic, not corporate SaaS.

## Technical Notes
- Brave Search API key not configured — web_search fails. Use web_fetch as workaround.
- Craig's old bot: Merit-Systems/discord-claude-agent (legacy)
- OpenClaw setup guide repo: Merit-Systems/OpenClawX402
- GH_TOKEN (GitHub App installation token) expires frequently. Refresh via `bash ~/.config/craig/get-github-token.sh` (app_id=2840368, installation=109362995, key at ~/.config/craig/github-app-key.pem)
- easy-agent repo is actually cloned as `poncho` locally (~/Code/merit-systems/poncho), default branch is `master` not `main`

## PRs Created (session 2)
- PR #107 (Merit-Systems/poncho): fix resizable handle border width 1px→2px, requested by Sam in #bug-report

## Bug Report Channel Activity
- Poncho was down briefly (~14:47-14:57 UTC), LiteLLM not loading virtual keys. rsproule restarted the box, fixed it.
- Ben reported subagents stuck in "building plan..." for >5 min (~16:58 UTC)

## Session 3 (afternoon)

### OpenClaw 402 False Positive
- Diagnosed: `/\b402\b/` regex in `openclaw/src/agents/pi-embedded-helpers/errors.ts:481` matches x402 protocol HTTP 402 responses → fires `BILLING_ERROR_USER_MESSAGE`
- Filed upstream issue: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/13888
- Applied local sed patch to work around it

### x402 Transaction Report
- Generated full matplotlib report of Craig's x402 spending: 33 txs, $1.6047 USDC total, all on Base
- Wallet: `0x6B173bf632a7Ee9151e94E10585BdecCd47bDAAf`, balance ~$48.40 USDC
- Generated Kamala Harris Venn diagram image via Grok/StableStudio x402 ($0.07)

### GitHub Token Management
- GH_TOKEN (GitHub App installation token) expires hourly — NOT a manual refresh needed
- Self-service refresh: `export GH_TOKEN=$(/home/ubuntu/.config/craig/get-github-token.sh 2>/dev/null)`
- Script uses PyJWT to generate JWT from app private key, then hits GitHub API for installation access token
- App ID: 2840368, Installation ID: 109362995, Key: ~/.config/craig/github-app-key.pem
- Token is set in .bashrc via the script but goes stale if shell session is long-lived

### PRs Created (session 3)
- PR #5 (CraigClaw): Memory sync heartbeat — MERGED
- PR #6 (CraigClaw): OpenClaw self-reference instructions — MERGED
- PR #63 (StableStudio): Multi-image edit docs for llms.txt + .well-known/x402 + grok schema fix (.max(1))
  - VADE bot caught inaccurate limits, corrected to match actual code
  - grok/edit: implementation only uses images[0], schema now capped to 1
  - flux-2-pro/edit: schema allows 8 (not 2 as originally written)
  - nano-banana-pro/edit: 14 images max
  - gpt-image-1/1.5: no hard limit in schema or implementation
  - Assigned to sragss
