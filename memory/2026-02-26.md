## Nova Discord Fix
- Nova (another AI agent) was bricked by bad Discord guild config (`enabled` key invalid)
- Also was responding in PropMarket server due to wildcard `*` guild with `users: ["*"]` + empty `channels: {}` (0 keys = allowlist not configured = allowed)
- Fix: removed PropMarket guild entry entirely, stop/sleep/start
- OpenClaw insight: empty `channels: {}` doesn't block because `Object.keys({}).length > 0` is false

## Pexels Videos
- Downloaded 8 Pexels videos using `curl_cffi` impersonation (regular curl blocked)
- Zipped and uploaded: https://f.stableupload.dev/j942ywhxfg/pexels-videos.zip
