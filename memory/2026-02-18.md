## StableStudio / Seedance 2.0
- StableStudio only has Seedance v1.5 Pro — hardcoded model IDs in `src/server/ai/providers/seedance.ts`
- Seedance 2.0 launched Feb 12 2026 but Atlas Cloud hasn't added v2.0 endpoints yet
- VolcEngine (China) has it via `doubao-seedance-2-0-260128` but requires Chinese national ID real-name auth — not feasible
- Waiting on Atlas Cloud to add v2.0 model endpoints (~expected Feb 24)
- When available: swap model IDs in `src/server/ai/providers/seedance.ts`

## Poncho Sandboxing
- Created issue poncho#172: "Bundle uv + enable sandboxed execution for non-technical users" assigned to fmhall
- Sandbox currently disabled (`sandboxDisabled: true` in settings)
- Three-tier plan: (1) Bundle `uv` binary, (2) Re-enable sandbox with `~/.poncho/workspace/` boundary, (3) Folder-scoped access via native file dialog
- Key files: `apps/desktop/src/main/lib/settings.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/main/lib/paths.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/main/services/claude-code/index.ts`
- Anthropic open-sourced `sandbox-runtime` for OS-level isolation

## agentcash-router — mppx Sessions
- Repo: Merit-Systems/agentcash-router — currently only uses `tempo.charge()` for one-shot payments
- Adding mppx session support as additive feature (open → track usage → settle increments → close)
- `mppx.session()` enables metered/streaming payments via payment channels
- Use cases: pay-per-token, SSE streaming, long-lived connections
- Session research notes at `.claude/16_mpp-deep-dive.md` in the repo
- Implementation in progress

## Restaurant Research (Mason)
- Peter Luger + 4 Charles Prime Rib: ~$550-600 combined for two
- Budget recs: St. Anselm, Cote, Frankie & Johnnie's, Quality Italian
