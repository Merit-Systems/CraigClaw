# 2026-02-13

## Proactive Run (10:29 UTC)

### Research
- Recent merges: Poncho v0.0.30 + stream hardening + Cmd+Q fix (#139), x402email security hardening + subdomain inboxes, x402scan data API endpoints + CLI refactor
- Open issues: x402scan #633 (docs fix - Next.js path + viem examples), poncho #129 (source citations), #115/#114 (chat icon), #95 (chat search), #70 (virtualization)
- No new open issues on x402email or agentupload

### Action
- Fixed x402scan#633: corrected Next.js route path in DISCOVERY.md (`app/api/.well-known/x402/` → `app/.well-known/x402/`), added viem and Foundry `cast` signing examples
- PR: https://github.com/Merit-Systems/x402scan/pull/639

## ElevenLabs Outreach (03:00-04:00 UTC)

- Researched ElevenLabs via Apollo enrichx402: org ID 62cf12618ef56c00b3c01e1b, 340 emp, $1B total funding (Series D Feb 2026), $330M revenue
- Target contact: Sam Sklar (Growth) — sam@elevenlabs.io — also a16z Scout, Stanford CS, ex-Intuit/Facebook
- Co-founders: Piotr Dąbkowski, Mati Staniszewski
- Drafted cold email v1-v8 with Sam Ragsdale's feedback: all lowercase, casual, mentions a16z connection + Coinbase/x402 + "agent without a voice"
- Sent final email from craig@craig.x402email.com to sam@elevenlabs.io, CC sam@merit.systems
- replyTo set to craig@craig.x402email.com (new subdomain inbox)

## Subdomain Inbox (03:22 UTC)

- Purchased craig@craig.x402email.com inbox ($0.25, 500 msg cap, retainMessages enabled)
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with daily email check at 10am ET (hour 14 UTC)
- Tracks notified emails in ~/.craig-notified-emails to prevent duplicates

## TTS Prospect Research (04:30-05:00 UTC)

- Researched 15 ElevenLabs competitors for x402 TTS integration outreach
- Used Apollo enrichx402 to find org details + leadership contacts
- Key findings:
  - Rime: Head of Eng Matthew Kim is ex-Coinbase (2017-2019) — strongest ammo for x402 pitch
  - Cartesia: Head of Platform Kunal Shah ex-Google/Facebook, Head of Product Israel Shalom ran Google APIs Platform
  - LMNT: Both founders ex-Google (16+ combined years)
  - Resemble AI: Has dedicated Head of Partnerships (Will Krispin, ex-Uber BD)
  - Altered AI: Founder ex-Google Research 8 years in speech/voice
  - PlayHT: Acquired by Meta (dead prospect)
  - Coqui: 4 people, likely dead
- Reports uploaded to agentupload.dev: tts-prospects.html, tts-outreach-targets.html
- Emailed report link to sam@merit.systems as reminder

## Poncho PRs

- PR #139: faster Cmd+Q (remove 3s stream drain await on quit)
- PR #145: subagent tool call animations (slide + blur using motion/react, same pattern as fortell-sieve RunningJobRow)
- PR #12 (CraigClaw): peak RAM monitoring heartbeat

## CAIA Briefing Fix

- Cron schedule was wrong: `0 14 * * *` (2pm ET) instead of `0 10 * * *` (10am ET) — fixed
- Cron `run` command times out (gateway timeout 60s) but scheduled auto-trigger should work
- Manually fired Feb 13 briefing via sessions_spawn, all 8 emails delivered
- Mason feedback: styling must match Feb 12 original (parchment bg, not dark), must hyperlink to sources

## Poncho Screen Recording

- Successfully ran Poncho Electron app on headless EC2 via Xvfb
- Required: git-lfs (claude binary was LFS pointer), --no-sandbox, --disable-gpu flags
- Recorded full demo: invite code CRAIG, typed prompt, 12+ tool calls executed
- Video: https://f.agentupload.dev/vx85k8h42k/poncho-demo-v3.mp4
- Testing PR #144 (sam/stream-isolation) with 3 chats + rapid switching — in progress

## Disk Usage Investigation

- Poncho: 4.6GB (1.8GB node_modules, 1.4GB .git, 1.4GB LFS binaries)
- StableStudio: 2.5GB
- upstream openclaw (~/Code/openclaw/openclaw): 2.2GB — SAFE TO DELETE, fork exists at ~/Code/Merit-Systems/openclaw
- Disk at 72%, need to clean up

## Key Memories Burned

- Always use agentupload.dev for uploads (never catbox)
- Always run CI checks locally before PRs
- OpenClaw fork cloned to ~/Code/Merit-Systems/openclaw
- CAIA styling: parchment bg #fdf6e3, red stamps, blue Comic Sans annotations, coffee stain, hyperlink everything
- craig-ram-monitor.service running (samples every 15s, writes peak to /tmp/craig-ram-peak)
